#To do file of what we should get done.

1) Open sequence from file and remove the header and useless stuff to only contain the CGAT sequence (maybe keep the sequence name info for the results)
2) Sequence Alignment
	*Local
	*Global
3) Web Application
4) Documentation

The first task is just to get the algorithm to run. Local alignment
- make the matrix with the strings displaying horizontally and vertically (like last semesters perl assignment)
- fill in the matrix with the representative values. 
- do the trace back effect
- alignmnet output
*Do we want to show the progressive states or do you just want them to provide the 2 strings and the final alignment result. 

Use the local alignment to create a global alignmnet. 
(if we have time we could map the protein alignment to the PAM250 matrix and stuff).
(web app if you feeling bored).
